This is the source code for paper [GTRL: An Entity Group-Aware Temporal Knowledge Graph Representation Learning Method]


## Data

We processed the ICEWS [1] and GDELT [2] and got three country based datasets:

GDELT18

ICEWS18

ICEWS14


## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7.7

- PyTorch 1.6.0

- dgl 0.5.0

- Sklearn 0.23.2

- Pandas 1.1.1


## Training and testing

Please run following commands for training and testing. We take the dataset `example` as the example.

**Event prediction**

python:

python train_event_predictor.py --runs 5 --dp ../data/ --gpu 1  -d example --seq-len 7
